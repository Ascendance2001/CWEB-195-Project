        <H2>A Stranger Comes to Town</H2>
        <H3>2001</H3>
        <p> This brochure documents an exhibition of film posters that trace the dramatic films that have been produced in Saskatchewan since the 1930s. 
            Saskatchewan films (and their accompanying posters) have achieved considerable maturity by the turn of the 21st century. 
            As such they have helped to both shed light on and obscure the character, history, and culture of the province. 
            This exhibition was installed in the Regina Public Library Film Theatre, November 28, 2001 to February 25, 2002 and moved to the Sherwood Village Branch Gallery, 
            March 7 to April 18, 2002.</p>

        <H2>Davin School Train Secrets</H2>
        <H3>HD Video, 70 seconds, colour, 2012</H3>
        <p>Davin is a school in our neighbourhood. It has a vast basement which is used by a model train collective, a group of older men who build a permanent display of these amazing scenes. Every year during the Cathedral Festival, they open their doors for visitors and I don't miss it. I love to photograph and videotape it, although the crowds of people often make it very difficult. I think that for a couple moments, the video can fool you into thinking it is real/full scale. However, once the truth is revealed, there is nothing left except a second trick. The final shot of the house is a still frame with shaky camera moves put in at the last minute to disguise the</p>

        <H3>digital and super-8, 8 minutes, black and white, 2016</H3>
        <p>Set in a timeless village occupied by shadowy characters and sentient creatures of the night, a strange child, distrusted by the community, must turn to the dark arts to appease his hunger, his loneliness, and his vengeance. Presented in partnership with The Caligari Project, a multi-disciplinary, city-wide public festival celebrating German Expressionism. It features William Bessai-Saul and Alice Willett and the voice of Dr. Christina Stojanova. The music was composed and performed by Erik Sirke who was also the cinematographer. Production took place over one day in 2016 in the Department of Film production studio at the University of Regina with a small crew of AJ Leeks, Geremy Lague, makeup artist Ginette Hall, and puppeteers Chrystene Ells and Rania Al Harthi. It is about a boy who is rejected by his community so befriends various creatures, a spider, mouse, and moth, which leads to much chaos and destruction. My first plan to have a practical animation loop projected through a plexiglas disc using a strobe light proved too difficult to create given the tightness of the shooting schedule. New animation, based upon drawings by William, was created in post production. The film premiered at the Dunlop Art Gallery Mediatheque in Regina as a continuously repeating loop from October, 2016 to January, 2017. In November of 2016 it screened at two online film festivals, the PopNinja Horror short festival and the Festigious International Online Film Festival where it was awarded Best Horror Film. It was also awarded (in a tie) best performance at the SAIFF (Southern Arizona Independent Film Festival) in April 2017. In September 2017 it was featured in the online Frostbite International Film Festival in Colorado and at the Pile of Bones Film Festival. Also in 2017, the film was shown along with the unveiling of a new silkscreen print by Beth Liber inspired by the film at the Flatgrafika Print conference. In November of 2017 it was nominated for a Saskatchewan Independent Film Award of "SIFA" (see promotinal trading card presented to nominees).</p>
