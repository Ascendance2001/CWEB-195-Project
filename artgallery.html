        <H2>A Stranger Comes to Town</H2>
        <H3>2001</H3>
        <p> This brochure documents an exhibition of film posters that trace the dramatic films that have been produced in Saskatchewan since the 1930s. 
            Saskatchewan films (and their accompanying posters) have achieved considerable maturity by the turn of the 21st century. 
            As such they have helped to both shed light on and obscure the character, history, and culture of the province. 
            This exhibition was installed in the Regina Public Library Film Theatre, November 28, 2001 to February 25, 2002 and moved to the Sherwood Village Branch Gallery, 
            March 7 to April 18, 2002.</p>

        <H3>HD Video, 70 seconds, colour, 2012</H3>
        <p>Davin is a school in our neighbourhood. It has a vast basement which is used by a model train collective, a group of older men who build a permanent display of these amazing scenes. Every year during the Cathedral Festival, they open their doors for visitors and I don't miss it. I love to photograph and videotape it, although the crowds of people often make it very difficult. I think that for a couple moments, the video can fool you into thinking it is real/full scale. However, once the truth is revealed, there is nothing left except a second trick. The final shot of the house is a still frame with shaky camera moves put in at the last minute to disguise the</p>

        <H2>Eye of Sorrow Moon</H2>
        <H3>digital and super-8, 8 minutes, black and white, 2016</H3>
        <p>Set in a timeless village occupied by shadowy characters and sentient creatures of the night, a strange child, distrusted by the community, must turn to the dark arts to appease his hunger, his loneliness, and his vengeance. Presented in partnership with The Caligari Project, a multi-disciplinary, city-wide public festival celebrating German Expressionism. It features William Bessai-Saul and Alice Willett and the voice of Dr. Christina Stojanova. The music was composed and performed by Erik Sirke who was also the cinematographer. Production took place over one day in 2016 in the Department of Film production studio at the University of Regina with a small crew of AJ Leeks, Geremy Lague, makeup artist Ginette Hall, and puppeteers Chrystene Ells and Rania Al Harthi. It is about a boy who is rejected by his community so befriends various creatures, a spider, mouse, and moth, which leads to much chaos and destruction. My first plan to have a practical animation loop projected through a plexiglas disc using a strobe light proved too difficult to create given the tightness of the shooting schedule. New animation, based upon drawings by William, was created in post production. The film premiered at the Dunlop Art Gallery Mediatheque in Regina as a continuously repeating loop from October, 2016 to January, 2017. In November of 2016 it screened at two online film festivals, the PopNinja Horror short festival and the Festigious International Online Film Festival where it was awarded Best Horror Film. It was also awarded (in a tie) best performance at the SAIFF (Southern Arizona Independent Film Festival) in April 2017. In September 2017 it was featured in the online Frostbite International Film Festival in Colorado and at the Pile of Bones Film Festival. Also in 2017, the film was shown along with the unveiling of a new silkscreen print by Beth Liber inspired by the film at the Flatgrafika Print conference. In November of 2017 it was nominated for a Saskatchewan Independent Film Award of "SIFA" (see promotinal trading card presented to nominees).</p>

        <H3>2020</H3>
        <p>For decades I have used cameras, but now I paint cameras. A camera's primary function is to take pictures. Through the careful observation required of painting, I have realized there is a logic to a camera's shape: the necessity for it to be comfortably held and used. The relationship between the photographer and the camera is intimate; these devices are grasped firmly but gently by a hand and pressed unhesitatingly against one's face. Every nook and cranny is to be committed to memory to allow sightless manipulation of dials and buttons, the camera responds to the slightest caress of the fingertip. Paint gives me a renewed relationship and heightened understanding of this all-important tool/toy/collaborator.</p>

        <H2>The Golem of Socks</H2>
        <H3>video, 5 minutes, 1995 </H3>
        <p>This video is a crudely created puppet video about community expectations, trust, and friendship. I made it in Toronto while I was feeling very uninspired by that city and did not want to leave my apartment to make anything. This allowed me and Margaret Bessai to collaborate and have a lot of fun. It was shot on high-8 video with the help of my good friend Angelos Hatzitolios on a blizzardy night in December, 1994. I wrote the story. Margaret read it aloud and created the puppets. I directed and edited it. The next term I wrote a paper about it in a Jewish film course. i had wanted the image to have lots of little cuts in it, to help make it reflect the stitched together nature of the sock golem; this was emphasized by an error with the tape whereas we did not fast forward and rewind the high 8 tape before using it. The tension was loose and we lost the control track occasionally. In 2003 when Ottawa's Saw Video wanted to web cast this video, I needed to restore it. Having lost the 3/4" edit master, I needed to bring all the high 8 footage into a computer for the first time and discovered that the tapes had degraded further. I needed to go through the cut frame by frame, fixing sync errors. This allowed me to emphasized this "stitched" approach. </p>
        <p>The puppets for the minor charactors Simon and Marsha were reused in a super-8 film "Attic Playroom". I have also created works related to this set of characters on artist trading cards on paper, the Golem was featured in our Christmas card one year (along with a potato stamp sleigh and our late cat, Baron Munchhausen), as well a tin sculptural cards, and have a forthcoming series with many of the characters (minus the Golem) called "Sock-vile" in the works to be created collaboratively with a team of students. These characters appear in a mini-comic with Canister the Robot called "The Inevitabilty Syndome" and in a film with Canister called Rockem, Sockem, Canister. </p>

        <H3>Ongoing film series since 2009 </H3>
        <p>This film series began with the idea of creating four films, each with a seasonal theme, exploring the collision of old and new technologies, of changes both in media as well as agriculture. I have been using 16mm and 35mm film stocks, as well as some images sourced from super-8. All of the film footage, both black and white as well as colour, is being hand-processed with attention on both the economics as well as environmental concerns. Coffee/caffeine is being investigated as a developing agent with some success (image above). As the project progressed, I found that ideas about seasons began to blur and become less relevant. The limitation of four films had been based upon the intention to complete each to a projectable film print, something I did with two of the projects ("I Can't See the Forest Through My Dreams" on 16mm and "Seeds" on 35mm) but as the years went by, the importance of film exhibition declined to the point of being impractical. Not only is it more difficult to accomplish, but almost no festivals or venues have the interest or ability to show work in this way. With the reduced expenses, I've decided to create a longer series to explore this form and these themes on an ongoing basis. </p>

        <H2>Life Is Like Lint</H2>
        <H3>16mm film, 80 minutes, 1999 </H3>
        <p>This film began as a traditional dramatic feature film with an emphasis on improvisation. Over the seven years I took to make it, much of the drama was left out in favour of fragmented moments of diary-style life observation. I used up dozens of rolls of different film stocks, cross processing all the reversal as negative and cutting everything together in a giant collage. The final version of the script is highly influenced by post-modernism as the characters fall in and out of character. The film has many mistakes but there are no accidents, I structured it to look extremely flawed but am very proud of the discrete structure I was able to build with this footage. It features me and my real partner Margaret Bessai in the rolls of two individuals a bit like ourselves but with many differences. The film is seen as creepy to our friends who recognize enough truth to start to believe that it is all true. I enjoyed hiding bits of truth inside the fiction, or vice versa. The film features cameos from Brett Bell, James Whittingham, Jean Oser, Jeff Nachtigall, Richard Kerr, and the Screaming Banana. It also features puppets designed by Margaret Bessai. This film may also be screened in fragments. Suggested excerpts are the opening animation, the coffee maker scene, the cereal box animation (by Margaret Bessai), and the hound dog puppet show that closes the film.</p>

        <H2>Persistent Visions</H2>
        <H3>16mm film loop installation, 1997</H3>
        <p>Over a series of eleven warm summer nights, I worked with a satellite space from Neutral Ground gallery and artist run centre to project 16mm film loops at a store front level. I changed loops regularly and was often able to watch from a bench situated across the street. What I learned from this was how unobservant or uncurious most people are as passers would frequently not miss a step or flit an eye at the film. I used primarily outtakes from previous projects and occasional found footage. Loops were each 8 - 20 seconds long and I would project for 2- 3 hours per night, sometimes changing films, sometimes not. There were three, 16mm projectors. We made friends with a Joanne, a young security guard who we primarily knew as "security girl". </p>

        <p>These tin works were made in my backyard to work out frustration in the summer of 2006 and exchanged as artist trading card at a session in Regina. I asked Margaret, who had originally designed the characters for this film, to do some small watercolours for them which were shrunken and put onto magnets to be figures living in these buildings. They can be moved and removed from the tin. </p>
